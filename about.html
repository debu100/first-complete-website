          <p>
            Trust and respect are things that have to be earned. Awareness comes
            from being top of mind. These should all be the end goals of your
            marketing strategy, from SEO and content marketing to social media
            and email.That's where your About Us page comes in. Your About Us
            page is one part autobiographical, one part educational and all
            parts human and personal to your customers. It showcases the
            background of your company, and takes your customer on the journey
            that has led to your business. Plus, it builds brand trust and
            loyalty, as well as sets you apart from your competition. Given how
            much they do, your About Us page is just about the last page you'd
            want to leave blank.
